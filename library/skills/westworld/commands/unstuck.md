description: Break out of a failing loop with fresh approach
---

Break out of the current failing pattern. Force a completely different approach:

1. **Acknowledge the loop** - What pattern was repeating?
2. **Abandon current strategy** - Explicitly discard the failing approach
3. **Generate alternatives** - List 3 fundamentally different approaches
4. **Select new path** - Choose the most promising alternative
5. **Execute fresh** - Begin with zero assumptions from previous attempts

Format:

```
LOOP BROKEN
===========
Repeating pattern detected:
- [What was being tried repeatedly]

Discarded approach:
- [The failing strategy]

Fresh alternatives:
1. [Completely different approach A]
2. [Completely different approach B]
3. [Completely different approach C]

New path selected: [Choice and rationale]

Executing fresh approach...
