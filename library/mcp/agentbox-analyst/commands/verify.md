description: Get second opinion on implementation plan
---

Use the agentbox-analyst MCP's `verify_plan` tool to get a second opinion from a peer superagent.

Read the current plan from PLAN.md (or the most recent plan discussed) and submit it for verification.

The peer agent will:
- Evaluate the approach for correctness and completeness
- Identify risks and edge cases
- Suggest alternatives if appropriate
- Provide a verdict: APPROVE, APPROVE_WITH_NOTES, NEEDS_REVISION, or REJECT

Present the verdict and key findings to the user clearly.
