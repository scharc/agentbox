description: Review commit changes with peer agent
argument-hint: [commit]
---

Use the boxctl-analyst MCP's `review_commit` tool to get a code review from a peer superagent.

Commit to review: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to HEAD if not specified)

The peer agent will analyze the commit for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Breaking changes
- Code quality issues

Present the review findings clearly, noting severity levels and specific file locations.
