description: Show current session, branch, and worktree context
---

Use the agentctl MCP's `get_current_context` tool to show where you are:
- Current tmux session name
- Working directory
- Git branch and commit
- Whether you're in a worktree
- Uncommitted changes status

Present the information in a clear, concise format.
